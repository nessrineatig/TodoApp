my application is a web application that allows the user to apodt a pet by clicking on adopt button, you change the view to a forum page where you can add your name and number and by clicking on submit , the animal selected will be deleted automatically from our database . 
In the nav bar , there's a button 'Add pet'.
 In case you want to add a pet for adoption   by clicking on it , it loads you to a forum where you add the name of the pet, its image , its need and its category and once you click on 'Add' you will be loaded to the main page and the animal will be aded to your page. 
 By clicking on search button , you can select the category desired and find the pet you are looking for...
